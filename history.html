                The riyal and qirsh have been the currency of Saudi Arabia since the country came into being, and In
                1960, the
                system was changed to 20 qirsh to a riyal, which was followed in 1963 by the introduction of the halala,
                one hundredth of a riyal. Some Saudi coins still bear denominations in qirsh, but it is no longer
                commonly used
            </p>

                In 1925, transitional copper coins for ¼ and ½ qirsh were minted in Makkah by King Abdulaziz. They were
                followed, in 1926, by ¼, ½ and 1 qirsh cupro-nickel pieces carrying the title "King of Hejaz and Sultan
                of Nejd". In 1935, the first coins were issued in the name of Saudi Arabia. These were silver ¼, ½ and 1
                riyal coins

                In 1963, the halala was introduced, and bronze 1 halala coins were issued. That was the only year they
                were struck. Cupro-nickel 5, 10, 25 and 50 halala followed in 1972, inscribed with their denomination in
                ghirsh or riyal (1, 2 qirsh, ¼, ½ riyal).
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1976, cupro-nickel 1 riyal coins were introduced, which are
                also inscribed with the denomination 100 halala. Bimetallic 1 riyal coins, also marked 100 halala, were
                issued in 1999. New series of 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 halalas and bimetallic 1 and 2 riyal coins was issued
                in 2016.

                This Saudi Arabian gold coin known formally as the Guinea but often colloquially known as the Pound. The
                specification is identical to the British Sovereign hence it's name derives a pseudo-British origin.
